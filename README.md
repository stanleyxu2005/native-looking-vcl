native-looking-vcl
==================

Delphi is my favorite R&D tool since 1995. I found that Delphi made application will look sightly different from Windows native application. The project proposes to fix these visual incosistencies between VCL components and native Windows controls. Please visit [http://stanleyxu2005.blogspot.com my blog] for updates.

I hope you enjoy using the library. The best encourage is to click "star" button from !GitHub page and watch me at [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/qian-xu/4/62a/70b linkedin].
