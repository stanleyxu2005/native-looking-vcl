# Native Looking Vcl

Delphi is my favorite R&D tool since 1995. I found that Delphi made application will look sightly different from Windows native application. The project proposes to fix these visual incosistencies between VCL components and native Windows controls. Please visit [my blog](http://stanleyxu2005.blogspot.com) for updates.

I hope you enjoy using the library. The best encourage is to click "star" button from !GitHub page. You can reach me out via [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/qian-xu/4/62a/70b).
